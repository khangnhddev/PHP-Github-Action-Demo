# GitHub Actions Demo with PHP

## Purpose of GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) platform integrated directly into GitHub. It allows you to automate your software development workflows right in your GitHub environment. GitHub Actions helps automate tasks such as building, testing, and deploying code when events occur in your repository (such as pushes, pull requests, issue creation, etc.).

## Benefits of GitHub Actions

1. **Direct GitHub Integration**: No need to use third-party CI/CD services, everything is integrated in the same place as your source code.

2. **Workflow Automation**: Automate processes such as code checking, testing, and deployment, helping to minimize manual work and errors.

3. **Diverse Environments**: Support for multiple operating systems (Linux, Windows, macOS) and multiple programming language versions.

4. **Rich Ecosystem**: Marketplace with thousands of community-developed actions available, so you don't have to "reinvent the wheel."

5. **Time Saving**: Automate repetitive tasks, allowing teams to focus on developing new features rather than manual processes.

6. **Early Bug Detection**: Detect and report errors as soon as new commits are made, helping to fix bugs quickly before they affect users.

7. **Easy Configuration**: Use simple YAML syntax to define workflows.

8. **Scalability**: Customize workflows to meet specific project needs.

9. **Transparency**: Clearly display the status and results of each workflow run, helping to track the CI/CD process.

10. **Compatible with Many Technologies**: Support for most popular programming languages and frameworks.

## Demo in This Project

This project demonstrates how to use GitHub Actions to:
1. Set up a PHP environment
2. Run a simple PHP script
3. Perform tests

The workflow configuration file is located in `.github/workflows/php-ci.yml`

## How to Use

1. Push code to a GitHub repository
2. GitHub Actions will automatically run the workflow when there's a push or pull request
3. You can also run the workflow manually from the Actions tab on GitHub
